1.What is the best practice in Java ?
      There should not be any data hardcode.
      Avoid using System Out Print Ln as they consume more memory.
      Program should have proper exception handling mechanism.
      Choose the datatype based on the requirement. Dont use always INT.
      There should be separate development envrionement and separate execution environment.
      Always use camelcase while declaring methods and variables
      Variables and methods should be readable
      All the programs should be in proper package.
